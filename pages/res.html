            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Dark Energy</h3>
            <p>Dark energy is a mysterious form of energy that constitutes about 68% of the universe. 
                It is thought to be responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. 
                Unlike dark matter, which exerts gravitational pull, dark energy has a repulsive effect, pushing galaxies apart at an increasing rate.
                <b>I am interested in finding alternative theories to the \(\Lambda\)CDM Model that better explain current cosmological observations.</b>
            </p>

            <h3>Modified Gravity</h3>
            <p>Modified gravity refers to a range of theories that extend or alter Einstein's General Relativity (GR) to address certain cosmological and astrophysical phenomena 
                that GR struggles to explain, such as the accelerated expansion of the universe and the behavior of galaxies 
                and galaxy clusters. 
                <b>I'm interested in testing these modified gravity models using cosmological data, 
                    such as weak lensing, CMB, and galaxy distributions.</b>
            </p>

            <h3>The Large scale Structure of the Universe</h3>
            <p>The large-scale structure of the universe refers to the 
                organization and distribution of matter on scales larger than individual galaxies. This structure is 
                characterized by patterns such as galaxy clusters, superclusters, filaments, voids, and walls, 
                which together form a vast cosmic web.
                <b>I'm interested in extracting new information 
                    relevant to cosmological models 
                    through simulations and observations of the LSS.</b>
